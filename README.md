# 🐱 BCI Bartender Cat Game 🍸

**A Brain-Computer Interface Cocktail Mixing Game**

Mix drinks, memorize recipes, and serve cocktails — all controlled with your brain!

## About the Game

BCI Bartender Cat Game is a pixel-art bartending game built in **Unity**, where you play as an adorable calico cat bartender mixing drinks behind a cozy bar. The twist? You can control it using a **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)** headset — the **Unicorn Hybrid Black** by g.tec.

**How It Works:**

1. **Memorize the Recipe** — A recipe card flashes on screen for 10 seconds, showing which bottles and how many shots of each you need.
2. **Mix the Drink** — Select the right bottles (keys `1`–`6` or via BCI input) to pour ingredients into the cocktail glass.
3. **Shake It Up** — Press `Space` to shake the drink.
4. **Serve** — Press `Enter` to serve. Match the recipe and win a golden trophy!

The game supports both **keyboard input** and **BCI (ERP-based) input**, making it a unique neurotechnology project that turns brain signals into in-game actions.

## BCI Integration

This project integrates the **Unicorn Hybrid Black** EEG headset using g.tec's **Unity ERP API**. The BCI module uses Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) to detect which on-screen bottle the player is focusing on, enabling hands-free ingredient selection through neural signals.

**Key Components:**

- `IInputSource` — Abstraction layer decoupling game logic from input method
- `KeyboardInputSource` — Standard keyboard controls for development and testing
- `BCIInputSource` — BCI-based input using the Unicorn Hybrid Black ERP pipeline
- `BCITrainingAutoBootstrap` — Automated training sequence for the BCI classifier
- `BottleFlashController` — Handles visual flashing of bottles for ERP stimulation and gameplay feedback

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

- [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/download) 2022.3.62f3 or later
- [Unicorn Suite Hybrid Black](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17qbtoRuF21MZq9gWymBsGcsaGAOl3G7E?usp=sharing) *(for BCI mode)*
- A Git client ([git-bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UVT-Neuroscience-Lab/BCI-Bartender-Cat-Game.git
   ```
2. Open Unity Hub → Open → select the cloned project folder.
3. Wait for Unity to import all assets.
4. Open the main scene from `Assets/Scenes/`.
5. Hit **Play** to start the game.

**Controls:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `1` – `6` | Add ingredient from corresponding bottle |
| `Space` | Shake the drink |
| `Enter` | Serve the drink |

> **Note:** For BCI mode, connect the Unicorn Hybrid Black headset through Unicorn Suite before running the game. The BCI training sequence will start automatically.
